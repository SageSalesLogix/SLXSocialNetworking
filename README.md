12/7/2010 - Mark Dykun - This Accelerator provides Twitter support to Sage SalesLogix 7.5.3 Client. It requires the Standard Problem/Resolution accelerator be installed first as it integrates with the Ticket Problem Type dialogs. The functionality augments several stock smartparts (Lead, Ticket, Defect, Ticket Problem Type) as well as the Link Handler (C# and Javascript) files. Make sure that you back the ones you have up and determine the change sets to migrate across. oAuth support is added in this release and before the user can post to twitter they will need to go to options tab and register the application with Twitter.
